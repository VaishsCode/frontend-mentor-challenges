## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to better structure HTML and CSS for responsive design. In particular, I improved my understanding of Flexbox and how to use it effectively for layout management.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="mainBox">
  <div class="blogImage">
    <img src="./assets/images/illustration-article.svg" alt="Blog Image" />
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <!-- content here -->
  </div>
  <div class="author">
    <img src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="author image" />
    <span>Greg Hooper</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

This code snippet shows how I organized the different sections of the card. I am proud of how I applied Flexbox to create a clean, structured layout.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

This CSS helped me center the content vertically and horizontally within the viewport, which was an essential part of making the layout look balanced on different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

In my future projects, I want to focus on improving a few important areas:

1. **CSS Improvement**: I am happy with how Flexbox is working for layouts, but I want to learn more about CSS Grid to handle more complex designs.

2. **Accessibility**: I will work on making my projects more user-friendly for everyone, especially people who use screen readers or keyboard shortcuts to navigate websites.

3. **Responsive Design**: Though I understand the basics of responsive design, I want to get better at using media queries, flexible typography, and responsive images to make my projects work well on all devices.

4. **JavaScript Integration**: For now, I have focused on HTML and CSS. In the future, I want to add JavaScript to make my websites more interactive.

5. **Reusable Code**: I want to learn more about creating reusable components in HTML and CSS and I also plan to learn frameworks like React to make web applications.

6. **Figma for Frontend**: I have learned the basics of using Figma to design for the web. I will keep improving my skills to make sure I can turn Figma designs into responsive and accurate websites.
