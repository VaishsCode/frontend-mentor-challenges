### What I learned

While working on this social media profile link project, I learned how to effectively create a clean, minimalistic profile card that displays a user's information and social media links.

# Continued Development

I aim to enhance my skills in JavaScript and learn how to make the site more interactive. Additionally, I would like to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions, to improve the user experience.
